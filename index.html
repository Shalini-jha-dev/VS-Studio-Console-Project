        <h2>About Visual Studio</h2>
        <p class="abt" >Visual Studio Code is a free source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS.[7] Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add additional functionality.

        </p>
        <p class="abt">Microsoft has released Visual Studio Code's source code on the VSCode repository of GitHub.com, under the permissive MIT License, while the compiled binaries are freeware.

        </p>
        <p class="abt">In the Stack Overflow 2019 Developer Survey, Visual Studio Code was ranked the most popular developer environment tool, with 50.7% of 87,317 respondents reporting that they use it.

        </p>
        <p class="abt">Visual Studio supports 36 different programming languages and allows the code editor and debugger to support (to varying degrees) nearly any programming language, provided a language-specific service exists. Built-in languages include C, C++, C++/CLI, Visual Basic .NET, C#, F#, JavaScript, TypeScript, XML, XSLT, HTML, and CSS. Support for other languages such as Python, Ruby, Node.js, and M among others is available via plug-ins. Java (and J#) were supported in the past.</p>

<h2>About Console Screen</h2>
<p class="abt">The console is the text output device for system administration messages. These messages come from the kernel, from the init system and from the system logger. On modern small computers the console is usually the computer's attached monitor and keyboard.
</p>

<p class="abt">It allows users to input commands and receive visual output from a computer or computer system. It is connected to another computer, server, or mainframe and is used to maintain or monitor the status of the network or computer.

<p class="abt">You should use the console. log() method to print to console JavaScript. The JavaScript console log function is mainly used for code debugging as it makes the JavaScript print the output to the console.</p>

<p class="abt">To open the console Screen, right-click on the page and select Inspect option, and then click on the Console tab at the top</p>
